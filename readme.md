##Â Implementation of active suspensions on the half car model available on my GitHub


To run the simulation you need to :
- Run the MATLAB script "main.m"
- Go to one of the two existing files "Simscape_assignment.slx" or "test_env.slx"

In "Simscape_assignment.slx", you will be able to observe the behavior of the real system implemented under 
Simscape with or without active suspension (toggle the switch).

In "test_env.slx", zou will be able to compare the linearized model with and without active suspension to two
different type of inputs (toggle the switch to go from speed bump to random road profile and vice-versa).

This code was written under MATLAB R2022a and works perfectly before release.
